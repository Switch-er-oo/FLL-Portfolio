# FLL-Portfolio
My Models and links to every Youtube video I created for my FLL team.

To reiterate my portfolio, Oryct3s is my most recent design and a stronger design than Cicind3la. However, I think that the models I have for Cicind3la serve as a useful demosntration of how I became a more skilled mechanic between the summer of 2020 and the summer of 2021. It should be noted that Cicind3la uses different electrical components to Oryct3s. Both use Lego mindstorm components, but Cicind3la uses Mindstorm components from the "Ev3" generation, whilst Oryct3s was made with components from the "51515" generation.

The "Frame_blank" files are attachments frames that have no additional tools attached to them (such as the belt, claw and probe that I added to my Oryct3s frames)

The conveyer belt frame model does not have the actual conveyer belt on it. The software could not render the chain.

The "Youtube" file lists some information about and a playlist for all my YouTube videos (unlisted).
