This GitHub page contains my models and links to every YouTube video I created for my FLL team.


This portfolio contains two designs, and initial design called Cicind3la and my most recent design Oryct3s. While Oryct3s is a stronger design than Cicind3la, the models I have for Cicind3la serve as a useful demonstration of how I became a more skilled mechanic between the summer of 2020 and the summer of 2021. It should be noted that Cicind3la uses different electrical components to Oryct3s. Both use Lego Mindstorm components, but Cicind3la uses Mindstorm components from the "Ev3" generation, whilst Oryct3s was made with components from the "51515" generation.

Digital links to all models as shareable Fusion360 models are included in the "Fusion360 links" file and all other files are downloadable from this page.

Please note that a variable called "winding order" that is used when creating COLLADA files can be used to optimize files when rendered by certain CAD softwares. The files that are linked as shareable Fusion360 models are optimized for autodesk applications. The files that are directly downloadable from this repository are more suitable for Previewer, Xcode and Blender. Why winding order has this effect is unknown to me.

The "Frame_blank" files are attachments frames that have no additional tools attached to them (such as the belt, claw and probe that I added to my Oryct3s frames)

The "YouTube" file lists some information about and a playlist for all my YouTube videos (unlisted).
