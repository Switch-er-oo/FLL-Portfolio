Description of YouTube videos
 
The playlist below lists my 21 YouTube training videos from oldest to newest. It should be noted that some of my videos are updates of previous versions of training videos. These updates were required because in 2022, Lego released a new generation of Mindstorms components called "51515." The 51515 components were very different to those of the previous generation Mindstorm version, EV3, and came with new software.
 
I felt the need to remake some beginner videos addressing these differences and using the next generation of Lego Mindstorms.
 
I would also like to add that my videos themselves were by no means spectacular and I do not recommend viewing any of them as part of my portfolio review. They featured questionable editing and I wasn't very well spoken in them. I include them as I think it is important to acknowledge their existence and the considerable ammount of work was put into their production. They also show my devotion to my team.
