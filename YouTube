A note about my Youtube videos:

The playlist below lists my 21 Youtube videos from oldest to newest. It should be noted that some of my videos had to be remade. 
This was because in 2022, lego released a new generation of Mindstorms components called "51515." 51515's components were
very different to those of it's previous generation and came with it's new software. I felt the need to remake some beginner
videos addressing these differences and using the next generation of Lego Mindstorms.

I would also like to add that my videos themselves were by no means spectacular and I do not recommend viewing any of them
as part of my portfolio review. They featured questionable editing and I wasn't very well spoken in them. However, I think
it is important to acknowledge their existence as a lot of work was put into their production and they show my devotion to 
my team.
